            <h3>Teaching Pedagogy</h3>
            <p>AEIE by virtue of its cutting edge quality of education, the uniqueness of its teaching-learning process
                and the continuous emphasis on the all-round development of students, has created a niche for itself. A
                harmonious integration of valued traditions with modern outlook is the guiding principle behind the
                development of academic environment of the Institute.</p>

                group discussions, interactive seminars, brain storming sessions etc. – all designed to expand and bring
                about qualitative growth. Through such programmes, students are constantly motivated and encouraged to
                develop their leadership qualities and improve their communication abilities. There is a constant
                endeavour on the part of the members of faculty and staff of the institute to help students in this
                grooming process.</p>

            <p>Although the assessment of the students’ performance is generally guided by the prevalent regulations of
                the University, the respective course teacher also adopts a continuous evaluation system independently
                to track and record the overall growth of students.</p>

                Industry-Institute-Interaction in the teaching-learning process.</p>
            <p>AICTE grant for setting up an Entrepreneurship Development Cell has been received for encouraging
                entrepreneurship activities.</p>
